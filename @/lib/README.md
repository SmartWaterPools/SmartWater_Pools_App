# Path Alias Placeholder

This directory is a placeholder to help npm resolve the `@/lib` path alias.

The actual libraries are located in the `client/src/lib` directory.

This directory and its package.json exist solely to prevent npm from trying to download
a non-existent package with this name during installation or startup.
