# Path Alias Placeholder

This directory is a placeholder to help npm resolve the `@/hooks` path alias.

The actual hooks are located in the `client/src/hooks` directory.

This directory and its package.json exist solely to prevent npm from trying to download
a non-existent package with this name during installation or startup.
