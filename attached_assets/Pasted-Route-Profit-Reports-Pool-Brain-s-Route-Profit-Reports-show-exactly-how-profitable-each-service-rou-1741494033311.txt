Route Profit Reports

Pool Brain’s Route Profit Reports show exactly how profitable each service route (or customer account) is, taking the guesswork out of financial decisions. The system automatically calculates profit per customer by comparing the revenue you invoiced against the actual costs for that stop – including chemical expenses and the technician’s pay ￼. Each account’s data is laid out with its invoiced amount, chemical spend, technician pay, and resulting profit in dollars and as a percentage ￼. This lets you see at a glance which customers are earning healthy margins and which ones might be costing you money. You can even set a custom profit percentage target or threshold to categorize performance: the report flags which properties are “good profit,” “low profit,” or “losing money,” based on the benchmark you define ￼ ￼. For example, if you consider anything below, say, 20% margin to be “low profit,” you can adjust the report’s settings and instantly see which accounts fall under that line ￼.

An example Route Profit report. The dashboard summarizes all active properties by profitability (green = profitable, yellow = low profit, red = losing money) and shows the average profit per property. In the table, each customer’s invoiced revenue, chemical cost, tech pay, and profit are listed, along with the profit percentage for that account. This transparency helps pinpoint unprofitable routes quickly. ￼ ￼

Having route-level profit insights helps pool service owners make informed decisions to improve their bottom line. If a particular customer or route stop is consistently unprofitable, you might decide to raise the service price, reduce costs, or even let that account go. On the other hand, identifying your most profitable routes can highlight what’s working well (e.g. certain service plans or efficient technicians) so you can focus on those strengths. In short, the Route Profit Report tells you “if you’re really making any money on that account” and “if a customer is worth keeping,” as Pool Brain puts it ￼. By automatically crunching these numbers, the software gives you concrete data to support your financial decisions instead of relying on gut feeling. This feature ultimately boosts efficiency by ensuring you allocate your time and resources to profitable business and address any money-losing routes before they drain your profits.

Technician Scorecards

Pool Brain provides Technician Scorecards that compile key performance metrics for each of your service technicians. When technicians know their performance is being measured, they tend to take pride in their work and stay motivated ￼. These scorecards track a variety of data points to evaluate both quality and efficiency of a tech’s work. For example, each technician’s scorecard displays:
	•	Customer feedback and satisfaction – It aggregates customer feedback (from the built-in one-click surveys) and even manager input, rolling it into a customer satisfaction score or rating for that tech ￼. You can instantly see how happy clients are with each technician’s service (e.g. number of positive vs. negative feedback instances).
	•	Operational stats – Key productivity metrics like average start time, average finish time, and time spent on site per job are recorded for each tech (as shown in their stats) to gauge efficiency. This helps in seeing if a technician is consistently running late or taking unusually long/short on jobs.
	•	Chemical usage and cost – The system tracks how much chemical each technician is using and the cost of those chemicals, giving insight into their resource usage ￼. For instance, you might notice one tech has a higher average chemical cost per pool than others, which could indicate overuse or tougher pool conditions on their route.
	•	Job costs and pay – Each tech’s labor cost or pay for route work is automatically calculated and can be factored into their scorecard ￼. This shows how much the technician “costs” relative to the work done, and can be used to evaluate profitability per tech or to manage commission structures.
	•	Trends and alerts – Pool Brain also highlights any notable trends or repeated alerts associated with a technician ￼. For example, if a particular tech repeatedly triggers certain service alerts (like “chemical readings out of range” or “not enough time on site”), those patterns will be visible. This helps management identify any ongoing issues or training needs.

Illustration of a Technician Scorecard for a pool tech. It shows the technician’s overall feedback rating (green/red bar under the name), their contact info, and a Stats panel (e.g. average start and finish times, average time on site, average chemical cost per pool). It also includes an Alert Trend pie chart (indicating the types of service alerts this tech has triggered, such as instances of low chlorine) and a graph of total chemical cost over the past 90 days. Such a scorecard gives a comprehensive view of both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency for the technician. ￼ ￼

By consolidating all these metrics, Technician Scorecards allow for more effective workforce management and quality control. Managers can easily see who is performing well and who might need additional training or support. For instance, if one technician’s scorecard shows high customer satisfaction and low chemical costs, you might use them as an example for best practices. Conversely, if another tech has low satisfaction scores or many alerts, you can intervene early – coach them on technique, adjust their route, or pair them with a mentor – before small issues become big customer service problems. The scorecards also introduce a level of accountability and motivation for staff: knowing that things like customer satisfaction and cost-efficiency are being tracked encourages technicians to follow procedures and strive for high marks. In summary, this feature benefits service quality by ensuring technicians maintain standards, and it aids workforce management by highlighting performance data in a fair, transparent way ￼. It’s easier to retain great technicians and improve those who are struggling when you have concrete metrics for feedback.

Graphs & Charts

Pool Brain includes a suite of interactive graphs and charts that visualize your operational data, helping you spot trends and understand the “story” behind the numbers at a glance. Instead of poring over spreadsheets or raw logs, you get visual dashboards that make it easy to identify patterns, anomalies, and correlations. The software tracks a wide range of data from your pool service operations – and just about all of it can be plotted on charts. For example, you can view charts of chemical readings over time (chlorine, pH, alkalinity, etc. for each pool), chemical usage and cost trends, filter pressure (PSI) readings, service visit durations, invoice totals, and more. These visualizations are designed to let you “spot patterns and trends easily and know the whole story with a glance” ￼. If something seems off in the data, the graphs are not just static images – they’re interactive. You can click on a data point or section of a chart to drill down into the underlying details, such as viewing the specific job or date that contributed to an anomaly ￼. This way, the cause-and-effect relationships become much clearer. For instance, a spike in your “chlorine use” graph might prompt you to click and discover it was due to an algae treatment at a particular pool that week.

Example of Pool Brain’s interactive charts dashboard. In this view, multiple metrics are graphed: a PSI (filter pressure) line graph (top left) helps track equipment performance, a Chlorine vs pH chart (top right) shows chemical balance trends, an Alert Trend pie chart (bottom left) breaks down the types of service alerts triggered (e.g. how often chlorine was low, pH high, etc.), and other graphs like Alkalinity/CYA levels and Salt levels (bottom) show water quality parameters over time. The top banner also displays total chemical cost over the last 90 days. By visualizing such data, Pool Brain makes it easy to identify anomalies (like a sudden drop in PSI or consistently low chlorine levels) and investigate further with a click. ￼ ￼

The Graphs & Charts feature turns raw data into actionable insights, which businesses can use to fine-tune their operations. Trending charts help you predict and respond to needs – for example, if you see chemical costs steadily rising month over month, you might renegotiate supplier pricing or adjust your service rates. If graphs of pool readings show that certain pools frequently have low chlorine, you can schedule additional treatments or inspect those pools for issues (like algae or equipment problems) proactively. The ability to correlate different data on the fly (thanks to the interactive design) means you can uncover cause-and-effect. As Pool Brain notes, this lets your team identify causality at a glance ￼ – maybe you’ll notice that whenever a particular technician is on vacation (seen on a timeline), the pH levels tend to drift in certain pools, indicating others aren’t servicing them as effectively. Armed with such knowledge, you can make operational adjustments such as retraining staff, balancing workload, changing routes, or alerting customers about potential issues before they escalate. Ultimately, the graphs and charts turn your routine service data into business intelligence dashboards. This improves efficiency by enabling data-driven decision making – you’re not just reacting to problems after they result in complaints or extra costs, you’re anticipating them by observing trends in the visuals.
