nderstanding the problem
The RpcError: Requests to this API places.googleapis.com method google.maps.places.v1.Places.AutocompletePlaces are blocked error indicates that your application is attempting to use the Google Places API's Autocomplete service, but the request is being denied by Google's servers. This blocking typically occurs for one of the following reasons:

API Key Restrictions: Your API key might have restrictions that prevent it from calling the Google Places API, or specifically the Autocomplete service.
API Not Enabled: The Google Places API (or the specific version v1 if applicable) might not be enabled in your Google Cloud Project.
Billing Not Enabled: Google Maps Platform services, including the Places API, require an enabled billing account even for free tier usage. If billing is not set up or has issues, API requests will be blocked.
Incorrect API Key: The API key being used might be invalid or incorrect.
Usage Limits Exceeded: While less common for a "blocked" error (often it's a OVER_QUERY_LIMIT status), exceeding free tier or paid usage limits could theoretically lead to blocking in some scenarios.
The stack trace shows that this error originates from the Google Maps JavaScript API (main.js), specifically when trying to fetch autocomplete suggestions.

Suggested fix
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that your Google Cloud Project is correctly configured for the Google Places API. Follow these steps:

Check API Key Restrictions:
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
Select the API key your application is using.
Under "API restrictions", ensure that "Google Places API" is listed and selected, or that "Don't restrict key" is chosen (though restricting is recommended for security). If you have HTTP referrer restrictions, ensure your domain is correctly listed, including *.yourdomain.com/* or yourdomain.com/* as appropriate.
Enable the Places API:
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services".
Search for "Places API" and ensure it is listed and enabled. If not, click "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES", search for "Places API", and enable it. Make sure you enable the correct version (sometimes there are different versions, e.g., "Places API" and "Places API (New)"). The error message refers to v1, which is typically covered by the standard "Places API".
Verify Billing Account:
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to "Billing".
Ensure that a valid billing account is linked to your project and that it is active. If not, set up a billing account. Google Maps Platform services are not entirely free, and require a billing account even for usage within the free tier.
Summary
The RpcError indicates that requests to the Google Places Autocomplete API are blocked. This is typically due to an improperly configured API key, the Places API not being enabled in your Google Cloud Project, or an issue with your project's billing account. Verify these settings in the Google Cloud Console to resolve the problem.
