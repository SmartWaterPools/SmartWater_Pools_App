Chemical Usage and Cost Tracking

One of the most powerful efficiency tools in Pool Brain is its Chemical Usage and Cost Tracking feature. Every time your technician services a pool, they enter the water test readings (e.g. chlorine level, pH, etc.) into the Pool Brain mobile app. The software then automatically calculates and suggests the exact chemical dosages needed for that pool on that visit, so the tech knows what to add ￼. This ensures proper dosing – technicians “always add the correct chemicals and amounts” thanks to automatic dosage recommendations built into the workflow ￼. It reduces the chance of human error or overuse of chemicals. Once the technician confirms what chemicals were added, Pool Brain logs the chemical usage and cost against that job and that customer. All chemical consumption is tracked automatically in the background, with no extra data entry or math required by your team ￼. The system records how much of each chemical was used, and because you can input your chemical prices, it also calculates the cost of those chemicals. This tracking happens at multiple levels: per job, per customer/property, per body of water (if a property has multiple pools/spas), per technician, and for your business as a whole ￼. For example, you can pull up a report or graph showing how many gallons of liquid chlorine a specific pool has consumed this year, or see the total dollars spent on acid by a particular technician over the last month. There’s even a dedicated Chemical Usage & Costs Report that can summarize these details over any time range ￼.

Pool Brain’s chemical cost tracking lets you break down chemical consumption by type. In this example, the report shows a total of $5,680.66 spent on chemicals over the selected period, with a pie chart detailing each chemical’s share. You can see the cost of Liquid Chlorine, Tabs, Muriatic Acid, Salt, Sodium Bicarb, Phosphate Remover, Stabilizer, etc., along with their percentage of the total. This level of detail helps identify which chemicals make up the bulk of your expenses (e.g. Liquid chlorine at 36.5% in the chart) so you can manage inventory and costs more effectively. ￼

Tracking chemical usage and costs closely serves multiple purposes. First, it helps ensure proper dosing and consistent water quality – the automatic calculations mean each pool gets the right chemical treatment, which avoids wasted chemicals and prevents situations like algae outbreaks due to under-dosing. Technicians are guided on what to add, which not only maintains pool health but also standardizes your chemical spend. Second, it provides cost control and transparency. Since you know exactly how much each chemical is used for each client, you can make sure you’re charging appropriately for chemicals (Pool Brain can even automatically add chemical charges to the customer’s invoice if desired). If a certain client’s pool is consuming an unusually high amount of chemicals, that might indicate a problem (like a leak or an ineffective equipment) or simply that the service price for that account should be higher to cover the extra chemical expense. The software even includes alerting mechanisms – for instance, it can trigger a “chemical cost too high on single visit” alert if a visit’s chemical usage exceeds a set threshold, flagging a potentially abnormal situation ￼. It can also detect patterns like a chemical level dropping consistently (e.g. cyanuric acid or salt levels trending down could mean the pool is leaking) ￼. These insights allow you to intervene early: fix the leak, adjust the service plan, or retrain a tech who might be overusing products. Lastly, having historical chemical usage data helps in inventory management and budgeting. You can forecast how much of each chemical you’ll need in upcoming months based on trends, and you can identify opportunities to reduce waste (for example, switching to a different product if one is consistently driving up costs). By automating the tracking of chemical doses and expenses, Pool Brain saves you from manual record-keeping and prevents “shrinkage” or overlooked costs. All of this contributes to a more efficient operation – you maintain balanced pools with the optimal amount of chemicals and keep your chemical expenses under control with full visibility at all times ￼.
