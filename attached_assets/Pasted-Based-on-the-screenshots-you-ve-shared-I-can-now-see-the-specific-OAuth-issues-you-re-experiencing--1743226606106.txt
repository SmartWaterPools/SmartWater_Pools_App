Based on the screenshots you've shared, I can now see the specific OAuth issues you're experiencing with your SmartWaterPools application. Let me analyze what's happening:

1. In the first screenshot, I can see the app is stuck on "Loading authentication state..." at the /login route.

2. The second screenshot shows that although a user can get logged in somehow, the authentication is incomplete - showing "User" with "No email provided" which suggests Google OAuth isn't passing or properly storing the user's email.

3. The third screenshot shows a clear error message: "Authentication timed out" - this is the key issue.

This timeout error typically occurs when the OAuth flow starts but doesn't complete successfully within the expected timeframe. Here are the most likely causes and solutions:

1. **OAuth Flow Timeout Settings**:
   - Your authentication flow might have a timeout that's too short
   - In your authentication logic, try increasing the timeout duration

2. **Token Exchange Issues**:
   - After receiving the authorization code, your app might be taking too long to exchange it for tokens
   - Check if there are any delays in your token exchange process

3. **Redirect URI Configuration**:
   - Double-check that your redirect URI in Google Cloud Console exactly matches what your app is using
   - For Replit apps, ensure it's using `https://smartwaterpools.replit.app/auth/callback` (or your specific callback path)

4. **Session Management**:
   - The error may be related to how your app stores the session during the OAuth flow
   - Verify your session management code, especially if you're using cookies or tokens

Here's what I recommend updating in your code:

```javascript
// If using something like Passport.js with Google OAuth
const googleStrategy = new GoogleStrategy({
  clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: 'https://smartwaterpools.replit.app/auth/callback',  // Ensure this matches exactly
  timeout: 60000  // Increase timeout to 60 seconds
}, async (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
  try {
    // Save user data including email
    const user = {
      id: profile.id,
      email: profile.emails[0].value,  // Make sure email is captured
      name: profile.displayName
    };
    // Your user storage logic here
    return done(null, user);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("OAuth error:", error);
    return done(error);
  }
});
```

Would you like me to help you diagnose further based on specific parts of your authentication code?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
