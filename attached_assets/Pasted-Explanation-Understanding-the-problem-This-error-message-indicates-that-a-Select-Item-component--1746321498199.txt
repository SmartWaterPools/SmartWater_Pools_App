Explanation

Understanding the problem
This error message indicates that a Select.Item component within a Radix UI (or a library built on top of it) Select component is missing the required value prop, or the value prop is an empty string. The value prop is essential for identifying the selected item and is also used internally by the component to manage the selection state. An empty string for the value prop is reserved for indicating that no item is currently selected (the placeholder state).

Suggested fix
Ensure that every <Select.Item /> within your <Select.Content /> has a unique and non-empty string value assigned to its value prop.

Here's a simplified example of how your code might look before and after the fix:

Before (causing the error):

Code

jsx
<Select>
  <SelectTrigger>
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select an item" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="item-1">Item 1</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="">Item 2 (problematic)</SelectItem> {/* Empty value */}
    <SelectItem>Item 3 (missing value)</SelectItem> {/* Missing value */}
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
Use code snippets with caution

After (fixing the error):

Code

jsx
<Select>
  <SelectTrigger>
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select an item" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="item-1">Item 1</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="item-2">Item 2</SelectItem> {/* Now has a non-empty value */}
    <SelectItem value="item-3">Item 3</SelectItem> {/* Now has a value */}
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
Use code snippets with caution

Locate the <Select.Item /> components in your code and add a non-empty string value prop to any that are missing it or have an empty string value.

Summary
The Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string... error means you have a Select.Item component without a valid value prop. Provide a unique, non-empty string value to each Select.Item to fix this.
