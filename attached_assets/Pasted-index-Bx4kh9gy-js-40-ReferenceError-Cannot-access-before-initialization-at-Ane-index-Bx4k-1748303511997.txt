Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error ReferenceError: Cannot access '_' before initialization indicates that you are trying to access a variable named _ before it has been declared or assigned a value within its scope. In the provided code snippet, the minified code uses _ as a variable name. This error suggests that somewhere in the execution path leading to Ane function, a variable named _ is being used before its declaration. This often happens in JavaScript due to issues with variable hoisting, scope, or temporal dead zone.

How to verify
The provided code snippet is minified, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact line where the issue occurs without the original source code. However, you can try the following to verify:

Locate the Ane function: In the unminified source code (if available), find the definition of the Ane function.
Inspect variable usage: Within the Ane function and any functions it calls, look for instances where a variable named _ is used.
Check for variable declaration: Verify if the variable _ is declared using let or const before its first usage in the relevant scope.
Suggested fix
Without the unminified source code, it's challenging to provide a precise fix. However, the general approach is to ensure that any variable named _ is declared before it is used.

If you have control over the unminified code, look for code that might look like this:

js

function Ane() {
  // ...
  _.someMethod(); // Error: Using _ before declaration
  const _ = someValue;
  // ...
}
Use code snippets with caution

The fix would be to declare the variable before its usage:

js

function Ane() {
  // ...
  const _ = someValue;
  _.someMethod(); // Correct: Using _ after declaration
  // ...
}
Use code snippets with caution

If you are using a library or framework that is causing this issue due to minification, you might need to:

Update the library to a newer version that might have fixed this issue.
Report the bug to the library maintainers if it persists in the latest version.
Summary
The error ReferenceError: Cannot access '_' before initialization means a variable named _ is being used before it is declared. This is likely happening within the minified code, specifically around the Ane function call stack. To fix this, ensure that any variable named _ is declared using let or const before its first use in the relevant scope in the unminified code. If the issue is within a third-party library, updating the library or reporting the bug to the maintainers might be necessary.
